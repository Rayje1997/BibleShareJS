# BibleShareJS

BibleShareJS is a JavaScript version of a project that was started in Python Flask.

It is being re-written in JavaScript so that it will be able to be temporarily hosted
on GitHub as a GitHub pages website.

It is designed to allow people to study their Bible in a desktop environment without
having to download and install any application and will be cross-platform and open-source.
